        <h4>Goooooaaaals!</h4>
        <p>We discovered last week how easy it was to add a data tracking system to our websites using <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank"><b>Google Analytics</b>(GA)</a>. This week I'll share how we can measure a website for performance in specific interactions. In GA terms, a goal is a specific interaction and a conversion is when a visitor completes that interaction. To begin using this tool, all you have to do is set a goal or multiple goals for your website. GA has an easy way to integrate them and it will track your site's progress toward those goals. We just love GA.</p>
          
        <h4>Destination and Events</h4>
        <p>As I stated in last week's blog post, Google Analytics is a tool with vast capabilities. Goals are one them. Again, goals are specific user interactions on your site, when a visitor performs your specified interaction, GA records that as a conversion, meaning that goal has been reached. The interactions can be anything from button clicks, form submissions, file downloads, etc. There are four different goal types to select from:<br>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Goals-Types.JPG" alt="Image of 4 Goal Types">
            <br><br>
        I created two goal types, a destination and an event. The set-up was easy. For the destination goal, I used the available GA <i>Share/social connect</i> template. I added the destination URL of my <a href="post7.html" target="_blank">Blog Post 7</a> to my Facebook wall and encouraged friends to go to it. For each conversion, I assigned a dollar value of $1 USD. I also added the Funnel option of tracking to see how visitors arrived at the conversion. In the funnel option I added the Step 1 entry way of the Index page, although this step is not required.<br><br>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Goals-Destination-Settings.JPG" alt="Image of Destination setting" width="350" height="500">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Goals-Event-Settings.JPG" alt="Image of Event setting" width="250" height="250"><br><br>
        
        The event goal tracks the number of clicks on the Subscribe! button I added on the Index page of my User Science Journal. I used the GA <i>Submission</i> template, which was meant for form submissions, but it served my purpose just as well. When visitors click on the Subscribe! button, it opens up a survey form for them to enter their email. The set-up required event conditions, I assigned attributes to those conditions. For each event conversion, I gave it a $150 USD value.<br><br>

        I added the following gtag codes on the Index page:<br>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Event-code.JPG" alt="Image of gtag codes"><br><br>

        The codes placed the Subscribe! button with its event conditions to the Index page:

        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Event.JPG" alt="Image of Index page"><br><br>

        <h4>Results</h4>
        To encourage traffic to the site, I posted another announcement on my Facebook wall. The results were great, considering I had expected just a one or two clicks. The overview showed, 8 completions total, 5 clicks on the Event goal and 3 clicks on the destination page with a Conversion Rate of 66.67% and 11.11% Abandonment Rate. The completions showed a total Goal Value of $753.00: <br><br>

        Details on the each goals are below:

        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Goals-Completions-Destination.JPG" alt="Image of Completions overiew"><br><br>

        The Multi-channel Funnels overview is also interesting, because I had expected most visitors to arrive via my Facebook post. However, as shown below, 87.50% of conversions were from direct and only 12.50% were from social:
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Goals-MultiFunnel-Event.JPG" alt="Image of Completions Event"><br><br>

        The Goal Flow visualization for the Event Goal showed, 3 entered through Facebook and 2 were direct:
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Goals-Flow-Event.JPG" alt="Image of Event Flow"><br><br>

        The Funnel visualization for the Destination Goal showed it was completed in 3 sessions with a 75% conversion rate:
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/Post8_Goals-Funnel-Destination.JPG" alt="Image of Destination Funnel"><br><br>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        My takeaways from this Goal exercise are Google Analytics is a great tool for tracking traffic on your website and in terms of conversions, word of mouth/direct marketing will yield a higher conversion rate than a general social media announcement marketing.
