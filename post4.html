          <p>This week I conducted a mobile usability test of the same website I used last week for usability testing. The sushi restaurant, <a href="https://www.sushimakiburien.com/" target="_blank">Sushi Maki</a>. 
          <p>
            <h4><b>Test Summary</b></h4>
            <b>Purpose</b>: To test for ease of use on a mobile phone, clarity of offerings, and siteâ€™s purpose.</p>
            <p><b>Testers:</b><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Older gentlemam man, handy man--self described as a "technology novice";</li>
                  <li>43 year old woman, school administrator--hates to order food online, but loves the convenience;</li>
                  <li>and 40 year old women, senior web developer--who does not like raw foods.</li>

                </ul><p>
            <p><b>Method</b>: I observed each tester individually. To remove the variable of different devices and operating systems, each tester used the installed web browser on the same Samsung Note8.</p>
          </p>
          <h4><b>Results Summary</b></h4>
          I followed the same <a href="Project_Usability_Testing_Script.pdf" target="_blank"><b><font color="red">script</b></font></a> I used last week for general usability.
          We started on the the home page. Each tester had a similar frist impression of the homepage, that it wasn't much on the page. The handyman stated that it's clear that it is a site for a sushi restaurant. Both the school administrator and web developer, indicated that the bareness of the page was unattractive.</p>
        <p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
              <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshots of the homepage taken April 27, 2019:</span>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/SushiMaki_mobile-home.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="col-6">
              <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshots of the homepage with menu taken April 27, 2019:</span>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/SushiMaki_mobile-menu.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
        </p>
      <p>The handyman's first activity was to swipe down to "Search Our Menu". To his dismay, when he tapped on the "Search products..." box, it did not bring up the restuarant's menu. He was already exasperated by this time and needed coaxing and coaching to continue on. He did not immediately know how to find the food selection menu. He did not know that tapping the black square with the three white lines on the upper right corner of the page would bring up the menu. When he finally found the food menu, he did not find it very helpful. He also felt that it was a bad choice not to have pictures of the food. His exact words were "Who ever thought this was a good idea should be fired!"<br><br>
      
      The school administrator first tap was on the menu. She found the items she wanted fairly quickly. When she tapped on an item, she was disappointed that it did not give any details other than price. She became frustrated when she discovered she could not order from the website. Having to call the restaurant to place her order was very inconvenient.<br><br>

      The web developer found the site to be usable and did not find any glaring problems. However, she felt they should have done more to make it obvious that the site was meant to serve as a stagnant menu and not a site for mobile ordering. 
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-4">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshots of the search box taken April 27, 2019:</span>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/SushiMaki_mobile-search-box.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
          <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshots of the search results taken April 27, 2019:</span>
          <img class="img-fluid" src="img/SushiMaki_mobile-searchresults2.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
            <span class="caption text-muted">Screenshots of the detail of menu item taken April 27, 2019:</span>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/SushiMaki_mobile-result-detail.jpg" alt="">
          </div>
      </div>
        <p>
        When prompted with the task of searching for a food item. The handyman said the site on the phone was useless. He doesn't eat sushi and a bare site on the phone certainly will not entice him to consider trying sushi. "What good is seach our menu, when you can't even find the menu?!" It took him a few random taps before he found the actual menu on the page. He finally typed "fish" in the search box. The search resulted in a list of items. It irritated him that again, there were no pictures and lack of decriptions of the items. <br><br>

        Both the school administrator and web developer were able to search for their items without much work. The both agreed that the items needed more descriptions.

        When asked whether the site was clear on how you can order items. All three answered no. All agreed the site needed to add more pictures and descriptions to their items. For those who are new to sushi, it would be difficult to make a determination on what to order without more information. <br><br>
        </p>
        
        <h4><b>Next Step Suggestions</b></h4>
        The testers found the site to function somewhat well on the mobile phone. The person with the most frustration was the handyman, who found the site to be the least usable. The layout of the site made the testers think they could order through the site, all were disappointed the only way to order was through the phone.<p></p>
